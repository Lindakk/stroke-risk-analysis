Use different machine learning models to classify low/risk of having a stroke
This project seeks to create a model using the dataset (‘healthcare-dataset-stroke-data’) so as to predict if a person is more likely to have a stroke based on features in the dataset such as gender, age, blood pressure, blood sugar, and marriage status, etc. I plan to use multiple machine learning models I have learned from this course as well as two other models I found online. I am aiming to find the best model to perform the classifications of the likely to have a stroke (stroke=1) and likely not to have a stroke (stroke =0).
This project has three sections. Section 1 focuses on cleaning and preparing the data (dropping null values, converting categorical values to numeric values) and analyzing the correlations between the features and the lable class. Section 2 focuses on using KNN, Logistic, and Random forest models to classify the stroke lable, and compute the associated performance matrices. Section 3 focuses on oversampling the data first and then applying different machine learning models so as to compare the results.
